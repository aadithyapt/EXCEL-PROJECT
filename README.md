# Employee Performance Evaluation in Excel

## Project Overview

This project evaluates employee performance using Excel's powerful functions such as `COUNTIF`, `SUMIF`, `AVERAGEIF`, and `RANK`. The dataset contains 500 records with details like tasks completed, hours worked, and performance ratings. The goal is to generate insights into employee performance, rank employees, and identify top performers across various departments.

## Features

- Count tasks completed by each employee using `COUNTIF`.
- Sum hours worked for employees in specific departments using `SUMIF`.
- Calculate average performance ratings per department using `AVERAGEIF`.
- Rank employees based on their performance rating using `RANK`.
- Visualize performance data with various charts.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:
- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee (e.g., E0001).
- **Name**: Name of the employee.
- **Department**: Department in which the employee works (HR, IT, Marketing, Finance, Sales).
- **Tasks Completed**: Number of tasks completed by the employee (ranges from 30 to 100).
- **Hours Worked**: Total hours worked by the employee (ranges from 100 to 200).
- **Performance Rating**: Employee's performance rating on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0.

## Usage

1. **Open the Excel File**: Download and open the `Employee_Performance_Evaluation.xlsx` file.
2. **Explore the Data**: Review the dataset and calculated fields such as total tasks, hours worked, and performance rankings.
3. **View Charts**: Examine the charts to visualize performance trends and departmental summaries.
4. **Modify and Analyze**: Add your data, tweak the formulas, or create new charts to conduct further analysis.

## Insights

- The dataset covers 500 employee records across five departments.
- The **IT** and **Sales** departments generally have higher task completion rates.
- Employees' performance ratings vary, allowing for the identification of top performers and areas for improvement.
